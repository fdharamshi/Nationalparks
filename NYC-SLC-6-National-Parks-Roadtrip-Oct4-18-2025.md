# NYC → SLC → Yellowstone-to-Zion “Grand Loop” (Oct 4–18, 2025)

**Flights**
- **Arrive SLC:** UA 2166 landing **10:19 AM** on **Oct 4, 2025**
- **Depart SLC → EWR:** UA 1553 **12:39 PM → 7:00 PM** on **Oct 18, 2025**

**Parks & Order (shortest sensible loop with Yellowstone first):**
**SLC → Yellowstone → Grand Teton → Arches → Capitol Reef (optional) → Bryce Canyon → Zion → SLC**  
This keeps you moving south in one sweep after Yellowstone, then straight up I‑15 to SLC—minimal backtracking, lowest total miles for visiting all six.

## Book‑Ahead Checklist
- **Arches timed entry** (required 7 AM–4 PM through Oct 31). Grab **Oct 10** AM; optional backup for Oct 11. You can still enter **before 7 AM** or **after 4 PM** without a ticket.
- **Zion Angels Landing** (optional): enter the **seasonal** or **day‑before** lottery. You can hike to **Scout Lookout** without a permit.
- **Shuttles:** Zion runs shuttles through October (Zion Canyon drive is shuttle‑only when active). Bryce shuttle typically runs into mid‑October (often through ~Oct 19).
- **Yellowstone roads/services:** Interior roads open into late Oct; some services/lodges close early Oct—fuel and pack food in West Yellowstone.
- **Grand Teton:** Teton Park Road generally open until Oct 31.

## Park‑Specific Pro Tips
- **Yellowstone (Oct):** Many services close early Oct; carry lunch, big water jug, and layers. Fuel nightly in **West Yellowstone**. Wildlife best near dawn/dusk (Lamar, Hayden).  
- **Grand Teton:** Fall color often lingers into early Oct; sunrise light is premium at Oxbow/Schwabacher’s.  
- **Arches:** Sunrise **before 7 AM** or sunset **after 4 PM** avoids the timed‑entry window. Midday is great for Windows/Double Arch shade.  
- **Bryce:** Stack **sunrise** + **Queens Garden/Navajo** loop; then drive the southern viewpoints (less crowded by late morning).  
- **Zion:** When shuttles run, **Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is shuttle‑only**—plan trailheads around shuttle stops.

---

## Food/Fuel & Restroom Cadence (baked into the times)
- **SLC → West Yellowstone:** Lunch **Ogden**/**Idaho Falls**; coffee/stretch at **Pocatello**.  
- **Jackson → Moab:** Lunch **Provo/Spanish Fork**; quick break **Price**; fuel **Green River** (last big services before Moab from the north).  
- **Moab → Torrey:** Fuel/rest **Green River** or **Hanksville**.  
- **Torrey → Bryce:** Scenic coffee at **Kiva Koffeehouse** (hours vary); restrooms at **Escalante Interagency Visitor Center**.  
- **Bryce → Zion:** **Thunderbird Restaurant** (Mt Carmel Jct) is the classic stop.  
- **Zion → SLC:** **Cedar City**, **Beaver (The Creamery)**, **Fillmore**, **Nephi**—plenty of clean, fast options.

---

## TL;DR Booking Bundle
- **Nights:** West Yellowstone **3**, Jackson **2**, Moab **2**, Torrey **1**, Bryce **1**, Springdale **3**, Provo/SLC **2**.  
- **Permits:** Arches timed entry (Oct 10 AM), Angels Landing lottery (aim for Oct 14/15).  
- **Keep flexible:** If weather turns in Yellowstone/GT, you have buffer later in trip (Oct 17) to adjust.
